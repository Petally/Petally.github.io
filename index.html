   <h1> The Map of Sparks </h1> <br> <br>
	   
	   <h2>The Town Plaza</h2> <br>
	   <p> A place with a fountain where meetings usually happen. This is a really popular place for gathering or just walking around.</p> <br>
	   <br>
	   <h2>The Storage Building</h2> <br>
	   <p>A building for storing food, and many other items of interest. Supplies have been down ever since the cave people arrived. This building is very good for supplying things to the people of Sparks. </p> <br> <br>
	   <h2>The Pioneer Hotel</h2> <br>
	   <p>A temporary housing unit for the Cave People for around half a year, until they are forced to leave. This isnâ€™t the best housing, and many people are doing graffiti all over it. An old and unused building.</p> <br> <br>
	   <h2>Sparks River</h2> <br>
	   <p>This is the natural river of sparks where we get water. It is a very popular spot to relax and to play.</p> <br> <br>
	   <h2>East Houses and North Houses</h2> <br>
	   <p>Most of the Sparks natives live in these houses. Ever since the cave people came, and intruding our families, the houses have been crowded.</p>
